## TicTacToe with Jetpack Compose
This repository contains a simple TicTacToe game implemented using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The game allows two players to play the classic XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game together. Let's dive into the details:
### Features
- Jetpack Compose UI: The entire UI is built using Jetpack Compose, making it concise and intuitive.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Supports two-player mode, where players take turns playing on the same device.
- Automatically detects win, lose, or draw situations and displays appropriate messages.
### Game Rules:
- Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (either "X" or "O").
- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
- If all 9 squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
